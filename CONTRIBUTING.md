### Development

To edit and compile documentation locally fetch npm dependencies
first: `$ npm install`. Then run `$ gulp build`.

There are two main [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) tasks:

* `$ gulp serve` - start a server and compile CSS on every edit
* `$ gulp publish` - publish changes to production
