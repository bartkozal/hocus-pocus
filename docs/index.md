Hocus-Pocus is a design-free [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
micro-framework.

The main idea behind is to make a universal and lightweight starter kit
that only includes the most common stuff. There is no need to overwrite
existing Hocus-Pocus classes because every default can be modified in
a clean way by changing a variable. I wrote [a short story](https://medium.com/@bkzl/hocus-pocus-e76a6d52801b)
why have I started working on another CSS framework.

Included features:

* Improved Normalize reset
* Default colors set
* Global box-sizing set to border-box (excluding `<img>`)
* Flexbox based grid
* Fraction width helpers
* Visibility and spacing helpers (automatically generated for all brakepoints)
* Responsive web design support with customizable breakpoints and approach (mobile or desktop first)
* Base typography with vertical rhythm and additional helpers
* Lists, definition lists and menus
* Image helpers
* Tables
* Forms
* Buttons
* Boxes
* Navbar
* Sticky footer

Sites built with Hocus-Pocus:

* [Echotags](http://echotags.io)
* [Shelly Cloud Status](https://status.shellycloud.com)
* [UIshots](http://uishots.com)
