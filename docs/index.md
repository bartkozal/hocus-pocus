Hocus-Pocus is a simple and design-free CSS micro-framework built with
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com).

The main idea behind the Hocus-Pocus was to make a universal and
lightweight CSS starter kit that only includes the most common stuff.
Every default can be modified in a clean way by changing a variable, so
there is no need to overwrite provided classes.

Features included:

* Normalize
* Colors
* Vertical rhythm
* Global box-sizing set to border-box
* Box-sizing for all elements (excluding `<img>`) is set to `border-box`
* Responsive support with customizable breakpoints (and approach, you can
  choose between mobile-first and desktop-first)
* Helpers: layout, spacing, size, visibility
* Components: type, list, rule, image, table, form, box, flash, navbar,
  sticky footer
* Extras
