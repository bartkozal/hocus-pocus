Hocus-Pocus is a simple and design-free [SASS](http://sass-lang.com)
micro-framework.

The main idea behind is to make a universal and lightweight starter kit
that only includes the most common stuff. There is no need to overwrite
existing Hocus-Pocus classes because every default can be modified in
a clean way by changing a variable.

Included features:

* Normalize
* Colors
* Vertical rhythm
* Flexbox grid
* Global box-sizing set to border-box (excluding `<img>`)
* Responsive with design support with customizable breakpoints and approach
  (you can choose between mobile-first and desktop-first)
* Components like: type, list, rule, image, table, form, box, flash, navbar,
  sticky footer
* Layout helpers, spacing helpers, size helpers and visibility helpers
