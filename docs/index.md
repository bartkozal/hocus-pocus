Hocus-Pocus is a design-free [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
micro-framework.

The main idea behind is to make a universal and lightweight starter kit
that only includes the most common stuff. There is no need to overwrite
existing Hocus-Pocus classes because every default can be modified in
a clean way by changing a variable. I wrote [a short story](https://medium.com/@bkzl/hocus-pocus-e76a6d52801b)
why have I started working on another CSS framework.

Included features:

* Normalize
* Colors
* Typography with vertical rhythm
* Flexbox grid
* Global box-sizing set to border-box (excluding `<img>`)
* Responsive design support with customizable breakpoints and approach
  (you can choose between mobile-first and desktop-first)
* Components like: type, list, rule, image, table, form, box, navbar,
  sticky footer
* Layout helpers, spacing helpers, size helpers and visibility helpers

Sites built with Hocus-Pocus:

* [Shelly Cloud Status](https://status.shellycloud.com)
* [Echotags](http://echotags.io)

Hocus-Pocus could not exist without work of awesome people responsible for
these projects:
