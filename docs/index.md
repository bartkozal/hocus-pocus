Hocus-Pocus is a universal and lightweight stylesheet starter kit that focuses
on base html elements and typography. You can change the look of every single
component, disable some features and define a range of helpers with variables.

## Why not Bootstrap?

 Libraries like Bootstrap or Foundation are great and have greatly changed how
 people think about CSS. However, in most cases within my own project work, I
 just donâ€™t need all these features and UI components like progress bars or
 breadcrumbs. Instead, I prefer to have something more universal that I can use
 in any project, without needing to override framework CSS classes.

## Key Features

The following framework features are the most characteristic to Hocus-Pocus:

* Enhanced [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) reset
* Default colors set and color helpers thanks to [clrs.cc](http://clrs.cc)
* Widely responsive web design support with customizable breakpoints and approach (mobile or desktop first)
* Flexbox grid with universal, fraction based width helpers
* Visibility and spacing helpers (auto-generated for the each viewport breakpoint!)
* Typography with vertical rhythm based on [Gridlover](http://www.gridlover.net/try)
* Components like lists, menus, tables, forms, buttons, boxes, navbar or sticky footer
* Universal media object

You can find full documentation at [hocus-pocus.io](http://hocus-pocus.io). I
always try to find time to improve it.

Code is open sourced [on GitHub](https://github.com/bkzl/hocus-pocus/). Up to
date changelog is available under [the releases
section](https://github.com/bkzl/hocus-pocus/releases).

I appreciate any comments, feedback, and information about potential issues.
