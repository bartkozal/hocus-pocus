  Hocus-Pocus is a universal and lightweight stylesheet starter kit that focuses
  on base html elements and typography. You can change the look of every single
  component, disable some features and define a range of helpers with variables.
</p>

<h2 id="why-not-bootstrap">Why not Bootstrap?</h2>

<p>
  Libraries like Bootstrap or Foundation are great and have greatly changed how
  people think about CSS. However, in most cases within my own project work, I
  just donâ€™t need all these features and UI components like progress bars or
  breadcrumbs. Instead, I prefer to have something more universal that I can use
  in any project.
</p>
