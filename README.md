Hocus-Pocus is a design-free [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) micro-framework
inspired by [primer](https://github.com/primer/primer).

The main idea behind is to make a universal and lightweight stylesheets starter
kit that only includes the most common stuff. There is no need to overwrite
existing Hocus-Pocus classes because every default can be modified in
a clean way by changing a variable. I wrote [a short story](https://medium.com/@bkzl/hocus-pocus-e76a6d52801b)
why have I started working on another CSS framework.

Included features:

* Enhanced [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) reset
* Default colors set (thanks to [clrs.cc](http://clrs.cc))
* Global box-sizing set to border-box
* Flexbox based grid
* Fraction width helpers (like in [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss/tools.widths))
* Responsive web design support with customizable breakpoints and approach (mobile or desktop first)
* Visibility, spacing and color helpers (generated for specified responsive breakpoints!)
* Base typography with vertical rhythm (based on [gridlover](http://www.gridlover.net/try))
* Lists, definition lists and menus
* Image helpers
* Tables
* Forms
* Buttons
* Media object
* Boxes
* Navbar
* Hero
* Sticky footer
* Clearfix

Sites built with Hocus-Pocus:

* [Echotags](http://echotags.io)
* [Shelly Cloud Status](https://status.shellycloud.com)
* [UIshots](http://uishots.com)
