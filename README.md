Hocus-Pocus is a design-free [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) framework
inspired by [Primer](https://github.com/primer/primer) and [InuitCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss/).

The main idea behind is to make a universal and lightweight stylesheet starter
kit that focuses on the most common features. There is no need to overwrite
existing Hocus-Pocus classes because every default can be modified in
a clean way by changing a variable. I wrote [a short story](http://www.sitepoint.com/hocus-pocus-building-a-design-free-sass-framework)
why have I started working on another framework.

Included features:

* Enhanced [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) reset
* Default colors set and color helpers (thanks to [clrs.cc](http://clrs.cc))
* Global box-sizing set to border-box
* Flexbox based grid
* Fraction width helpers
* Responsive web design support with customizable breakpoints and approach (mobile or desktop first)
* Visibility and spacing helpers (generated for specified responsive breakpoints!)
* Base typography with vertical rhythm (based on [Gridlover](http://www.gridlover.net/try))
* Lists, definition lists and menus
* Image helpers
* Tables
* Forms
* Buttons
* Media object
* Boxes
* Navbar
* Hero
* Sticky footer
* Clearfix

Sites built with Hocus-Pocus:

* [Echotags](http://echotags.io)
* [UIshots](http://uishots.com)
