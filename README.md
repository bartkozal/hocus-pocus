# Hocus-Pocus [![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/bkzl/hocus-pocus/branches/master/shields_badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/bkzl/hocus-pocus)

[Hocus-Pocus](https://bkzl.github.io/hocus-pocus) is a universal and lightweight stylesheet
starter kit that focuses on base html elements and typography. You can change
the look of every single component, disable some features and define a range
of helpers with variables.

## Why not Bootstrap?

Libraries like Bootstrap or Foundation are great and have greatly changed how
people think about CSS. However, in most cases within my own project work, I
just donâ€™t need all these features and UI components like progress bars or
breadcrumbs. Instead, I prefer to have something more universal that I can use
in any project.

## Key Features

The following features are the most characteristic to Hocus-Pocus:

* Enhanced [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) reset
* Default colors set and color helpers thanks to [clrs.cc](http://clrs.cc)
* Widely responsive web design support with customizable breakpoints and approach
* Flexbox grid with universal, fraction based width helpers
* Visibility and spacing helpers (auto-generated for the each viewport breakpoint!)
* Typography with vertical rhythm based on rem units
* Components like lists, menus, tables, forms, buttons, boxes, media object and sticky footer
